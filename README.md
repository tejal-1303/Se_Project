## About The Project

We wish to provide a platform for people to hone their coding capabilities and simultaneously work on a single question by collaborating.
Using this project, users can write and edit the written code online. It allows the writing of well-formatted source code with line enumeration, tab support, and live syntax highlighting. The editor supports error checking, code completion, and basic editor functionality such as block indentation, bracket matching, and the numbering of the lines of code.
The application's essential features include a collaborative environment in which users are allowed to work together and a chat application where they can discuss the problem with one another too.
Our platform supports the user in solving questions from famous coding websites like Atcoder and CodeForce, and one can achieve this by using a simple URL. Users with certain companies and topics in mind will find our application resourceful as we segregate questions on this basis. Our project supports everyone from beginners to professionals in the field of competitive programming as we allow the users to choose their difficulty level from easy, medium, and difficult.
At the same time, changes in the code are handled adequately so that users cannot edit parts of the code that could cause conflict at any point in time. It supports C++, Python, Java , JavaScript, Rust, GoLang, PHP, Ruby, and Haskell programming languages.

Follow the instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm

   ```

   example : `git clone https://github.com/tejal-1303/Se_Project.git`

3. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm run install-modules
   ```

4. Start the react and nodejs server concucrrently

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Execute Code

To allow cuacus to execute code, you need to get your api keys from [JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/) and add them to the `.env` file
Update: I have included API keys from a dummy account, you can get your own also from JDoodle, the keys are restricited to 200 executions per day, and is visible to everyone, you can get your own private key at JDOODLE

```text
JDOODLE_CLIENTID=get_your_key
JDOOLDE_CLIENTSECRET=get_your_key
```
